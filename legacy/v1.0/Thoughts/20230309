Good prediction; prices moved towards desired target
bad execution: did not add appropriate stoploss, volatility spike triggered close too early causing major losses
at resistance: take profit first, buy back later

Larger time frame: high volatility, should have stayed out of the market
Trades: follow bias by larger time frame, time entry at lower time frame
